                It would be easy to say I am running for Student Body President at K-State because I want to see and create change on our campus. While, yes that is true that’s ultimately what we all want as students- a better K-State. For me, Student Body President goes far beyond the title. It’s about pouring everything into serving students and giving back to the university that has given me so much. I believe it takes an experienced student leader to create progress. There are no simple solutions to the frustrations and concerns many students have, but that fact can not stop action necessary to move our university forward. One the things that makes K-State what it is, is the value put on the student voice. Through my deep experience in SGA, I have had the opportunity to see that statement tested, challenged and put to use. I have seen what it means to hear those concerns and communicate it effectively to all kinds of stakeholders. I want to not only continue that work, but push it a step further and empower students to expect more from every aspect of their college experience. I got involved in SGA as a freshman with no idea what the organization was truly capable of and stayed because of the purpose and mission behind it.

                        I’m running because my passion for K-State started at age 9 when I saw the ‘Cats beat a nationally ranked Texas team in OT by a field goal in the last few minutes and have been emotionally committed to this university ever since. K-State has given me both friendships and opportunities that were greater than I could have ever imagined.
                        Our four years at K-State are defined by the chances we take, and the challenges we tackle- whether it’s getting your degree, taking on extracurriculars, or making lifelong friends- we choose the path we take. I am running for Student Body Vice President to make that path a little smoother; from helping fellow students pay for a high quality education through changes in campus policies, to finding free resources they didn’t even know we had on campus. Higher Education means so much to me, and it has opened up whole new worlds for many students. It is my duty to improve students lives on their journey to a degree, in order for them to become valuable members of society and put more high quality K-State graduates on the map.
