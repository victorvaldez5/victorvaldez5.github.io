                        The biggest concern of students in college is paying for college. We must emphasize on affordability as many students struggle with scholarships, paying out of state tuition, and purchasing textbooks year after year. By providing resources to faculty
                        to reduce the cost of their classes, we'll be able to expect more, for less.

                    <div id='content-text'>
                        It’s not about creating entirely new resources, but instead putting existing resources back in the hands of students so we are utilizing what is available. Greater access to resources can solve issues with retention and help students know what programs
                        are offered on campus which are put in place to assist the needs of students free of charge.

                        The voice of students is an integral piece that makes K-State what it is. We count on both ourselves and others to provide the best college experience possible through academics and campus life. Accountability is important as we maintain the priorities
                        made by student administrations in past years and cater to the changing needs of students today.

                                    transfer or international students. The one thing they have in common is that the orientation process is supposed to give them all the information they need to be a successful K-State student. Throughout the day students
                                    are given information regarding resources on campus, involvement opportunities, how to enroll in classes, meeting with an advisor, etc. Many students walk away forgetting key pieces of information and feeling overwhelmed.

                                    currently covered on the orientation day would be converted to modules within Canvas. Students would be able to see the information before they arrive on campus and then the orientation day can go a level deeper or
                                    reinforce knowledge
